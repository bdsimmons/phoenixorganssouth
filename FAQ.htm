single most important reason our customers give us for
choosing a Phoenix Organ is simply this, &ldquo;the sound&rdquo;.
Regardless of endless discussions of technology, memory
capacity, processors speeds, or sample length, the most
important item in any organ, pipe or digital, is the quality
of the sound.</font></p>







              
              
              
              
              
              
              <p align="justify"><font color="#808080" face="Arial" size="2">Phoenix
Organs has not only all of the technological advancements
needed for great sound production, but also a very important
added component&hellip; art. The art of sampling&hellip; the art of
console design&hellip; the art of organ building. Since Phoenix
Organs builds every organ as a custom organ, every aspect of
the process of designing and building your new organ is
completely under the watchful eyes and skillful hands of the
dedicated and knowledgeable Phoenix Organs staff. Every
detail, from concept to completion, from design to rigorous
final testing, is carefully completed to the high standards
only a custom builder can offer.<br>







              <br>







One thing that is so difficult for so many to realize is
that buying a Phoenix Organ is not a catalog shopping<br>







experience! Phoenix does not have catalog brochures from
which a customer picks &ldquo;Model XYZ&rdquo; with &ldquo;Console Style
ABC&rdquo;, shipped directly from the factory warehouse. Nor
does Phoenix just choose 3 items from &ldquo;column B&rdquo;, and 2
from &ldquo;column A&rdquo;, a big &ldquo;widget&rdquo; from isle 4-A and
toss it on a cart and place it on the assembly line and call
it a custom organ. All Phoenix Organs are truly hand-built,
part-by-part, by highly skilled craftsmen, technicians and
engineers. Your organ will be referred to at the Phoenix
shop by your name! You can choose just how &ldquo;custom&rdquo; you
want your organ, or you can tell Phoenix Organs what your
ideas are and let them do what they do best&hellip; design and
build a one-of-a-kind organ that will be unique, just for
you.</font></p>







              
              
              
              
              
              
              <p align="justify"><font color="#808080" face="Arial" size="2">Unusual
to the digital organ world, Phoenix Organs produces every
organ with the same level of quality, using the same console
materials and controls, the same technical components, the
same audio equipment, and the same level of sampling, in
every organ, large or small. Phoenix Organs does not have
&ldquo;economy&rdquo; or&ldquo; starter&rdquo; organs. Phoenix Organs does
not divide their organs into the categories of &ldquo;good&rdquo;,
&ldquo;better&rdquo;, &ldquo;best&rdquo;, and &ldquo;really, really best&rdquo; like
the big assembly line companies tend to do. If you purchase
a Phoenix Organ with 2-manuals and 19 stops, or a 4-manual
organ with 120 stops, the quality will be consistent&hellip; the
only difference will be the quantity of organ you have
purchased! That&rsquo;s the way it should be.</font></p>







              
              
              
              
              
              
              <p align="justify"><font color="#808080" face="Arial" size="2">Phoenix
Organs do not become obsolete. The Phoenix Organ system was
designed from the beginning to be updateable and
upgradeable. Being a modular system, individual components
can be updated if ever needed or desired. Phoenix can
incorporate any advancement, whether software or hardware,
which may be made, retrospectively into any already
installed Phoenix Organs. Indeed, this has been done. With
this policy of constant and ongoing improvements and
refinements, and the ability to implement these into any
present or future organ, the possibility of obsolescence is
virtually eliminated. If at some time in the future, a
customer so desires, we can even do a complete &ldquo;re-build&rdquo;
of the entire organ, instead of trading it in for a new
organ!</font></p>







              
              
              
              
              
              
              <p align="justify"><font color="#808080" face="Arial" size="2">If
your church should have the resources to purchase a new pipe
organ or re-build an existing one, we strongly encourage you
to investigate those possibilities. But if your church finds
itself in a situation that prevents a pipe organ, be it
space or finances, then we think that Phoenix Organs offers
the very best &ldquo;next thing&rdquo;! And finally, not the most
important, but significant nonetheless, is the amazingly
realistic pricing of these completely hand-built, custom
organs. We have found over the past few years that Phoenix
Organs are usually less expensive than any high-end assembly
line organ manufacturer, while still offering a much
superior console and sound production. That&rsquo;s not an easy
thing to do, but once you sit at a comfortable Phoenix
console and hear it for yourself, we are sure you will
agree. <i>Play a Phoenix Organ soon!</i></font></p>

chance encounter one day happened to place two engineers in
the same room. They began talking and very soon it emerged
that both were also church organists. For years they both
had been searching for an electronic organ that sounded like
a pipe organ. Neither had met such an animal before, despite
long treks to check out exaggerated claims by many
manufacturers about their latest offerings that, although
sporting a fancy trade name or a suitable acronym, did not
show much improvement.</font></p>







              
              
              
              
              
              
              <p align="justify"><font color="#808080" face="Arial" size="2">At
this point in time sampling technology was in its embryonic
stage. They were convinced that the growing lists of current
instrument builders were only scratching the surface of the
technology that was available. Thus, Phoenix Organs was
born. The system was designed from the "ground up"
with a clean sheet of paper, and is now the most flexible in
the marketplace today. Gone are the "standard"
specifications, the "standard" models. Everything
is Custom built and easily alterable even after the organ
has been built. Mixture ranks can be added and compositions
changed, pistons can be given different functions, and the
control over each note of each stop uses ten times the
parameters that the competitors have at their disposal. The
system uses computer soundcard chips that are easily
obtained and will be with us for many years to come. Phoenix
has now grown into many parts, using common system
electronics allied to localize manufacturing centers.
Phoenix Organs America, which, as it's name implies, is the
manufacturing center for the North American continent, based
in Ontario. Brothers Don and Jim Anderson, both of whom have
many years' experience in the organ business, run Phoenix
NA. From the very beginning Phoenix was an international
company with representation in UK, N. Ireland, United
States, Canada, and Australia.&nbsp; Phoenix will soon move
into other European countries. Also, there are other organ
builders using the Phoenix system for their organs.&nbsp; At
the center of it all is Phoenix Organs UK, which supplies
the system boards to both the NI and USA operations. Dave
Bostock, who is the brains behind the whole system, runs
Phoenix UK. His programming skills, together with his tonal
and musical expertise, are directly responsible for the
success and flexibility of the Phoenix system.</font></p>

Phoenix is custom built, not just variations of a standard
mass-produced model. The electronic organ industry has been
trying for over thirty years to emulate as closely as
possible the might of the "King of Instruments".
One thing that a lot of manufacturers have missed is that no
two instruments of similar size, even from the same builder,
can ever sound the same, nor should they sound identical.
Each organ should have it's own unique character.&nbsp; From
the day your organ is ordered to the day it is delivered, it
will be referred to by YOUR name, not a production number.</font></p>

are several non-winded organ manufacturers who are, in fact,
attempting to build a quality product. Of course, most
prefer to churn out a number of &lsquo;units&rsquo; per year on an
assembly line. Every Phoenix, large or small, is custom
built as with a pipe organ. Many, if not all, pipe organ
builders endeavor to provide a custom organ. We believe that
every installation is totally different, and requires the
right instrument for the surroundings.</font></p>

The <b>Phoenix Organ System </b>can control wind blown ranks
of organ pipes as well as digital ranks. Facilities are
available within the control system for ranks of pipes to be
attached to divisions of the organ and played through the
console being managed by the Phoenix System. This enables
the Phoenix System to be used to supplement an existing (or

of providing top-notch electronics for both electronic
organs and pipe organs. Hybrid organs (mixing both pipe and

built. Our electronics can be supplied in kit form with
complete instructions to pipe organ companies. Every Phoenix
electronic organ is capable of controlling pipes. The same
'front-end' is used for scanning of keyboards, stops,
pistons, etc. for both sample playback system and pipe
magnets. The speed of the scanning is extremely fast and a
separate microprocessor is used for each keyboard. It is
actually done in parallel as opposed to the linear (all in a
row) scanning as in many other control systems. With the
Phoenix system there is no sluggishness of the key response
as more stops are added.</font></p>

The Phoenix system can control any number of ranks of pipes.
Considering that, the benefits of having digital ranks, and
a very reasonable cost, makes Phoenix a very attractive
choice for console replacement.&nbsp; Due to the high cost
to build pipe organs and the space limitations in many
churches, hybrid or combination organs have become popular.
It has become common for pipe organ companies to add
digitally sampled stops in place of expensive 32&rsquo; pedal
ranks. Some churches that cannot afford a full pipe organ
opt for a compromise of a number of ranks of pipes added to
a non-winded organ. The Phoenix pipe control system is well
engineered and has been lauded by pipe builders for its ease
of use. All Phoenix Organs are ready for pipes in the event
a church decides to do so in the future.</font></p>

is a comment made by a Phoenix customer about their
pipe/digital combination Phoenix:<br>







                <br>







                <i>"Some very critical organ builders and organists
have heard and played the instrument and totally agree that
the Phoenix has some of the highest quality samples that
they have heard on a digital organ, regardless of price. The
sampled stops blend seamlessly with the existing Casavant
pipe organ ranks. I am especially pleased with the English
Romantic samples from the Harrison and Harrison and Willis
organs, as well as the fine quality French samples. The
organ technicians were very impressed with the ease of
installation of the pipe interface. I found the usual
American digital organ choices lacking in tonal quality and
having overall lack of definition in their ensemble sound.
The Phoenix instrument sells itself."<br>

up-to-date in the world. Our circuit boards and

accordingly. Thus today&rsquo;s organ will go out-of-date less

How are Phoenix Organ consoles built?</font></b></a></p>







              
              
              
              
              
              
              <p align="justify"><font color="#808080" face="Arial" size="2">Building
of organs brings together many different crafts and by far
the largest proportion of work and indeed cost goes into the
cabinet. If you consider the console of any instrument with
which you are familiar, the over-riding material used is
wood. The console is a piece of furniture, as handsomely
finished as anything which would grace your dining room. You
sit on a solid wood seat which must withstand the rigors of
organists - including the heavyweights. The keys sit on a
shelf far thicker and more rigid than an average dining
table, and this supports anything up to 75% of the total
weight of the console. These and many other factors make the
quality manufacture of the console of paramount importance.</font></p>







              
              
              
              
              
              
              <p align="justify"><font color="#808080" face="Arial" size="2">Phoenix
consoles are made to Phoenix's own design by thier own
craftsmen. Using experience gathered from many years in the
pipe and electronic organ building business, each organ is
designed and built from the ground up using the finest
hardwoods and hardware available. Unlike some organ
companies which utilize MDF (medium density fiberboard), we
use only the finest North American select hardwoods and
16-ply hardwood veneer-core for strength. Pedalboards have
laminated maple capped naturals over strong Canadian Ash.
From the beginning, Phoenix Organs decided all consoles
would reflect the pleasing proportions of many of our
beloved North American pipe organ builders. Of course, most
of the European, production-line organs on the market
typically have skimpy sides, keybeds and lids. Phoenix
consoles have pleasing proportions, including thick sides,
keybeds and tops. In fact, the basic design idea of the
rounded cheek was taken from Aeolian Skinner. We expect that
when you sit at a Phoenix Organ, whether lighted stop tablet
or drawknob, you will feel you are playing a good pipe
organ, plain and simple.</font></p>

our long and close association with Forbes &amp; Associates
we have a more than 45-year history in placing quality
organs in churches, institutions, and homes throughout the
Southeastern United States. For the past decade we have been
co-coordinating sales, promotions, and performing all
installations for Forbes &amp; Associates, and doing
business under his name. We have profited from his vast
experience as our long-time mentor. Ken Forbes, the owner of
Forbes &amp; Associates passed away in January 2004, and
soon after we changed the business name to D.L. Simmons
&amp; Company.&nbsp; Mr. Forbes served the churches of the
Southeast with care and integrity for many years and we
continue on the path he followed. The owner of D.L. Simmons
and Company has been a church organist for over 30 years and
also has extensive experience in construction, architectural
design, fine woodworking, and holds a B.F.A degree. We work
with our customers to find the perfect instrument for their
needs without artificially inflated prices or unnecessary
costs from high overhead. We provide professional
installation and voicing of every organ, large or small.
Being able to work closely with Phoenix Organs gives us a
very broad and deep knowledge base from which to draw to
ensure a successful organ project from the very beginning.</font></p>

just seems to be part of doing business today. &nbsp;We do our best to
NOT talk about our compeditors and would much rather talk about
everything Phoenix Organs has to offer. &nbsp; Possibly you should
disregard or even investigate any allegations, negative sales
techniques, or competition bashing. This kind of sales technique is
called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear%2C_uncertainty_and_doubt">"FUD"</a>
(stands for 'fear', 'uncertainty','doubt'), and is often used as a last
resort. Usually, when a salesperson resorts to negative attacks of a
competitor it signals their insecurity about their own product's
ability to stand up to their competitors'.</span></small><small style="color: rgb(102, 102, 102);"><span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">
&nbsp;Every committee should take the time needed to conduct a thorough
search. Don't be pressured by a pushy salesperson that talks too much
about other builder's organs. Your recommendation for a particular
organ will be an expenditure of your church's precious funds and will
affect its music ministry for many years to come. &nbsp; We have a
