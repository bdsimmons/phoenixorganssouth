Detroit. With this silent-era spectacle, Cecil B. DeMille cemented his
reputation as the master of the biblical epic. DeMille tells the story of
Christ's life and Passion with great attention to historical accuracy, along the
way paying homage to the religious illustrations of Da Vinci and Doré, and, in
a modern flourish, restaging Christ's resurrection in luminous Technicolor.</font></td>

How to Master the Art</a> -- Gerre Hancock has long been renowned for his
extraordinary improvisations, and has for many years taught the art of
improvisation at classes and workshops across the United States. Now he has
codified and organized his teaching into a book which carries the organist from
the scale through the fugue, covering on the way interludes, hymns, hymn
preludes, sonata form, canon, and more. Written in an informal style and
illustrated with musical examples and exercises, this book opens wide the door

Since the first appearance of Harold Gleason's Method of Organ Playing in 1937
it has been the most comprehensive and complete tool on the market for training
first-class organists. The Gleason method is unique among books of its kind in
that it has been in a continual state of evolution throughout its eight
editions. The vast practical and pedagogical knowledge of Harold Gleason and his
wife, concert organist Catharine Crozier Gleason is presented in the most
up-to-date fashion in the current eighth edition. Every page of the book
reflects both first-rate and recent scholarship as well as tried and true
materials for beginning players.</font></td>

Manual: Technical Studies and Selected Compositions for the Organ</a> --
Reviewer: (A reader)&nbsp; I have studied organ at the undergraduate and
graduate levels at several music universities. I hold a BS in music education
and a graduate certificate in church music. The organist's manual by Davis is,
in my opinion, far superior to the Gleason Method. All technical exercises and
selection of repertoire is more interesting. I understand the organ much better
after using the Davis book. I own all of the Gleason methods, but I find myself
using and playing from the Davis book more. I congratulate Mr. Davis on this
fabulous instruction manual. Will there be a second edition??? I hope so.</font></td>
