statement often made by knowledgeable organists and pipe

is: <span style="font-style: italic;">"The acoustic is the number one stop"</span>. Simply
put, this means that no matter how good an organ may be,
it's success depends very much on the acoustic of the room
in which it is installed. All too often churches purchase
expensive, well-made organs (both pipe and electronic) only
to be disappointed after installation due to an acoustic
that fails to enhance church music. When the room acoustic
is right an organ of inferior tone quality can even sound
acceptable while an organ of outstanding tonal quality will
sound absolutely thrilling.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font>

are often presented with totally opposing views</font></i></b><font color="#808080" size="2">
on what is considered 'good acoustics' by church music
experts and P.A. experts. It is sometimes confusing for
committees who are given the important task of making a set
of decisions that will influence the success of music in the
church for decades to come. The advice of those with
knowledge and experience in the traditional church music
field should always be taken seriously. While a 'good'
acoustic in a theater is one thing, it is an entirely
different matter in a church. The former is usually 'dry'
due to a great deal of sound absorbent material on all
surfaces within the room (no reverberation), while the
latter will be a 'live' room with more than 2 seconds of
reverberation. A church with a high ceiling and all surfaces
sound reflective is by far the best for organ and choral
music. Time and time again it has been proved that both
organ and choir sound better in the right acoustic as it
carries and blends the tone, making it more musical.
Wall-to-wall carpet is one of the worst enemies of church
music. It is not even necessary to carpet aisles with the
aim of deadening the sounds of footsteps as there is now

this absorbs a large percentage of the sound before it gets
a chance to travel anywhere. Without a reverberant acoustic
it is like trying to play a piano without any sustain pedal!
It is dry and dull. A good architect, who is sensitive to
providing a good acoustic for organ and choral music, can
design a room that works well for both music and speech. In
our experience P.A. technicians will most often say that any
'echo' needs to be removed with the addition of as much
sound absorbent material as possible. In this case, spending
a lot of money to purchase a top-notch organ or piano, or
putting a lot of effort into building a good choir will
always result in second rate music. The shape of the room is
best if it is rectangular and the ceiling should be high. It
is generally easier to project sound into a room with a high
ceiling than in one which is low. Materials covering walls,
ceiling and floor should be reflective, but limiting the
numbers of flags and banners also helps. The frequencies of
organ stops cover the widest spectrum of any musical
instrument: from 16 to 20,000 cycles, and the materials used
on these surfaces play a very important role in governing
the amount and rate of sound reflection or
absorption.&nbsp; <br>

Sound Fields</font></h3>



              <font color="#808080"><b><i><font size="2">While
many electronic organ companies rely heavily on digital
reverberation</font></i></b><font size="2"> systems to mask
the actual tone quality of their instruments, there is no
need for electronic reverberation in an organ that is placed
in a good church acoustic. Phoenix Organs use Lexicon Reverb
systems to help poor acoustic situations such as in small
churches and homes. Lexicon is one of the few electronic
reverbs that closely simulates a church acoustic without the
objectionable 'ping-pong' effect so often heard. A sound
field may be created that may be quite satisfying to the
organist himself - he may think he is playing in Westminster
Abbey at times - but what about when there is a choir and
congregation? They are left singing in whatever acoustic
that the room has with no benefit from the artificial
reverb. As good as electronic reverberation systems have
become, they are usually of little use in church and
attempts to create artificial sound fields are almost never
successful from the viewpoints of choir and congregation.
When an organ is used for practice at home, a good reverb
system can enhance the sound to the point of making it a
pleasure to play. This, again, is due to the usual dry
acoustics of small carpeted rooms.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></font>

            <b><i><font color="#808080" size="2">The
room in which an organ is placed becomes an integral part of
its sound system</font></i></b><font color="#808080" size="2">,
much as the sound board of a piano is an integral part of
that instrument. The organ builder is, in a way, only adding
the strings and mechanism to the sound board. It is
extremely important that not only the best possible acoustic
environment be attained for the organ, but that the best
possible placement of the organ's speaker system be found.
So, in addition to choosing a suitable organ specification,
no matter what size the instrument is, two further elements
must be placed high on the list of prerequisites: the room
must carry the sound of the organ well and the placement of
the organ speakers must be favorable. All too often,
electronic organ installers are not aware of the importance
of this factor or they don't care. Getting the organ 'in'
and the check in hand is all that too many organ sales
people care about and the resulting complaints from
organists, clergy, congregation and choir then fall on deaf
ears. The organ should ideally speak directly down the main
axis of the building and the speakers should be situated
close to the singers, preferably behind and above their
heads. Because most organs are installed in existing
buildings, there are normally limitations placed on the
ideal situations described above. For this reason we
recommend a serious consultation with an acoustician or at
least an organist or organ builder with good knowledge and
recognizable success in church work. This is a complex but
important matter that with the correct decisions will be
appreciated for generations to come.</font></div>
