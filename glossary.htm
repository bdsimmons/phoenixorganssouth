            <td style="width: 100%; vertical-align: top;"><small><b>Acoustics</b> &ndash; The study of
sound frerquencies, including musical tone and how they intereact with each other and
with physical surroundings. Room shapes, wall, ceiling an floor designs, and building
materials create the acoustic properties of a room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acoustically live rooms have long reverberation times while the
acoustically dead (dry) rooms with carpet, drapes, padding, acoustical ceiling
tile, and other sound energy absorbing materials may have little or no
reverberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To support good
congregational and choir singing, a reverberation time of at least 1-1/2 to 2 seconds
is recommended.<span style="">&nbsp; No echos! &nbsp;</span>Proper
acoustics allow speaking with&nbsp;minimum or no amplification and also allows organ
and congregation and choir voices to blend to create a satisfying musical experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To understand acoustics effect on musical enjoyment, ask
yourself, &ldquo;Where does my voice sound better; in a closet with soft absorbing
materials, or in the shower with hard reflective surfaces?</small><br>

            </small><br>



            <small><b>A.G.O.</b> &ndash; The American
Guild of Organists.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This organization
has set specifications for the standardization of organ consoles, organ
placement, order of stop controls, and proper couplers, etc. The A.G.O. grants
proficiency degrees on the basis of annual examinations: Associate (A.A.G.O.),
and Fellow (F.A.G.O.). It also publishes a monthly magazine called &ldquo;The
American Organist&rdquo;.</small><br>

            <small><b style="">All Swells to Swell
Switch</b> - This allows for control of all expression pedals with the Swell
pedal only. When used the all divisions expression will be controlled by the
Swell shoe only.</small><br>



            <small>



            </small><br>



            <small><b>Antiphonal</b> &ndash; This organ
division is usually placed at the opposite end of a room from the main organ.
It is used for echo effects, alternating choruses, or for augmenting the main
organ in congregational singing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
pipe organs, the Antiphonal is a separate division. I digital organs it can be
a division speaking through a separate set of amplifiers and speakers.</small><br>



            <small>



            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<b>Blower</b> &ndash; A motor driven
unit that produces a wind supply necessary to produce sound in a pipe organ.</small><br>



            <small>



            </small><br>



            <small><b>Celeste</b> &ndash; Celeste is Latin
for &lsquo;heavenly&rsquo;.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An organ celeste
consists of two eight foot stops played simultaneously with one stop tuned
slightly sharp to the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
interaction of the two sounds produces a slow beat or undulation creating an
warm ensemble sound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For example, in a
orchestra there are many violins playing the same note, each instrument having
an ever so slightly different pitch and tone-quality combines to create that
characteristic warm string ensemble sound.</small><br>



            <small>



            </small><br>

            <small>



            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p><b>Chamber</b> &ndash; A room, usually
open on at least on one side, in which pipes or speakers for the organ are
placed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The open side is often finished
with a decorative grill and grill cloth, and opens into the church or
auditorium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These openings should be as
large as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pipe organs may have
Swell shutters placed in the opening, which when opening and closing, control
the volume of sound heard from the pipes in the church or auditorium.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Swell shutters are operated by the Swell
Shoe (Expression Pedal) with the organist&rsquo;s foot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Chambers should be finished with hard, ridged, reflective
surfaces like plaster, thick plywood, or double layers of sheetrock painted
with a gloss paint to provide proper tonal egression. </small><br>



            <small>



            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p><b>Chiff</b> &ndash; The transient
harmonic component that precedes the tone in a pipe voice of flue pipes. This
type of articulation is useful in playing contrapuntal music.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Choir Division</b> &ndash; Usually
denotes the bottom keyboard of an organ with three or more manuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This division operates as an accompaniment
division and also provides the stops for the traditional Postiv division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It usually contains both principal and Flute
ensembles with couplers to increase its flexibility.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Combination Action</b> &ndash; Any
device on an organ by which previously selected groups of stops can be
activated by the pressing of a button (piston), or toe stud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The means by which these combinations of
stops are retained in the organ memory are:</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <br>

&ndash; Combinations that do not visibly affect the stops already set. This system is
used on small organs and the stop selections are not programmable or
changeable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are set at the factory
or can only be changed by a technician.</small><br>

&ndash;This refers to the programmable memory in the organ that allows the organist
to set stop combinations assigned to a particular piston for recall as
needed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Capture systems can have as
many as 99 memory levels and 4 to 12 pistons which give the organist over 1000
individual memories.</small><br style="">



            </div>



            <small><br style="">




            </small><small><b>Compound Stops</b> &ndash; Stops
with draw multiple ranks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Roman
numerals indicate the number of ranks drawn, such as &ldquo;Mixture IV&rdquo;.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Concert Pitch</b> &ndash; An organ
with middle A tuned to a frequency of 440 Hertz (cycles per second).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Denoted as &ldquo;A-440&rdquo;.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Console</b> &ndash; Usually
constructed of fine woods, it can be very plain or extremely ornate. The
console is the organist&rsquo;s control center or workstation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It contains manual and pedal keyboards, and
stops controls arranged in a standardized and convenient manor specified by the
American Guild of Organists in American, and by other organist organizations in
other countries.</small><br>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Couplers</b> &ndash; There are two
basic types of couplers:</small><br>

&ndash; Enables an entire division&rsquo;s stops to be played on another keyboard, or by
the pedals; sometimes at the same pitch level and sometimes at different
pitches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examples would be &ldquo;Swell to
Great 16&rsquo;&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Swell to Choir 8&rsquo;&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Great to Pedal 4&rsquo;&rdquo;.</small><br>

            </b>&ndash; Enable an entire division to be played with itself but at an octave
higher or lower.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examples would be &ldquo;Swell
to Swell 16&rsquo;&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Great to Great 4&rsquo;&rdquo;. Also, an entire division can be silenced
using the <b>Unison Coupler</b>. </small><br>

            </small><br>



            <small>3)<span style="font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b>Within
the above</b> &ndash; <b><i>Sub Couplers</i></b> are at the 16&rsquo; pitch; <b><i>Unison
Couplers</i></b> are at the 8&rsquo; pitch level; and <b><i>Super Couplers</i></b>
are at the 4&rsquo; level.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Couplers greatly
increase an organ flexibility.</small><br>



            </div>



            <small>&nbsp;</small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Crescendo Pedal</b> &ndash; The
Crescendo Pedal (usually the right-most shoe), gradually adds pre-selected
stops in succession as it is depressed all the way up to full organ. </small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Diapasons</b> &ndash; See Principals</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Divided Expression</b> &ndash; More
than one expression pedal on the organ so voices on one division may be
controlled, up and down in volume, while voices (stops) in another division are
unaffected.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Division</b> &ndash; The traditional
groupings of pipe ranks: Great, Swell, Choir, Solo, Pedal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each is played from the keyboard named after
that particular division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having
multiple divisions, each with a separate keyboard allows for rapid changes in
registration as the organist moves from one keyboard to another.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Drawknob</b> &ndash; The oldest and
most traditional manner of operating the stops of an organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A knob with the name of the stop engraved on
it is pulled out to turn on the stop and pushed in to turn it off.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Echo Organ</b> &ndash; An Antiphonal
organ usually using softer stops; used for effects of an ethereal nature.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>En Chamade</b> &ndash; A loud,
horizontal solo trumpet stop.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Enclosed</b> &ndash; Pipes located
in an organ chamber or other enclosure with adjustable swell shutters that open
and close to control volume.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Expression Pedal</b> &ndash; A
foot-operated pedal, which on a pipe organ opens and closes the shutters of the
swell box (chamber), controlling the volume of an organ division. On digital
organs the expression pedal controls not only the volume, but also attenuates
the higher frequencies of the sounds, giving the characteristic &ldquo;caged&rdquo; sound
when closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On better digital organs,
all of this is adjustable, along with the volume taper at closing and opening.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Extensions</b> &ndash; Normally 12
additional pipes added at the bottom and/or top of a pipe rank, allowing that
rank to play an additional octave higher or lower pitch.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b style="">External Speakers</b> - Appropriate high quality speakers mounted in a
location away from the console.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Fa&ccedil;ade</b> &ndash; The front display
pipes that are exposed and visible on an organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These can be decorative or functional.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Finishing</b> &ndash; The subjective and artistic process
whereby the various elements of an organ are adjusted, controlled, modified,
and harnessed to provide the musical personality of the instrument. Finishing
on-site must be done by a person with a good ear and knowledge of music.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be finished, an instrument must be voiced
and tuned on each individual stop and individual notes.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Flue Stops</b> &ndash; Stops belonging to the Principal,
Flute, Hybrid, and String families of pipes, also called &ldquo;Labial&rdquo; pipes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flues generate their tones by the action of
a sheet of wind which passes through a small gap or flue against a lip in the
mouth of the pipe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sets a column
of air in motion within the walls of the pipe in the same manor as a whistle.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Flutes</b> &ndash; The tonal family
that supports the Principals and also provides another set of tonal colors for
solo and accompaniment voices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flutes
may be open, stopped, or tapered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Open
and tapered flutes are full-length flue pipes. Stopped flutes speak an octave
lower than their length would suggest because of the cap or stopper which
closes the top of the pipe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Gedeckt
and Bourdon are examples of stopped flutes.<span style="">&nbsp;
            </span>The Melodia is an example of an open flute, and the Spitzfl&ouml;te is an
example of a tapered flute. Tapered flutes are narrower at their tops than they
are at their mouth.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Foot (Pitch)</b> &ndash; The general
term used to indicate the manner in which pitch is designated on an organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rank of pipes, the longest of which is 8
feet long, will produce the standard concert pitch on an organ keyboard;
consequently such a stop is called an 8&rsquo; stop.<span style="">&nbsp;
            </span>A 16&rsquo; stop speaks the octave below; a 4&rsquo; stop speaks an octave above,
etc&hellip;</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Fractional Pitches</b> &ndash; Organ
stops that speak other than unison or octave pitches, that is, 5-1/3&rsquo; or 2-2/3&rsquo;
or 1-3/5&rsquo; or 1-1/3&rsquo; and others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
are also called Mutations and are useful in building solo combinations such as
Cornets, but can also add color to ensembles.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Fundamental</b> &ndash; The portion
of the musical tone that defines the pitch of the tome to the ear, normally the
lowest pitched harmonic of the tone.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Great Organ</b> &ndash; The most
important division of the organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Other
manual divisions usually couple to it with 16&rsquo;, 8&rsquo;, and 4&rsquo; couplers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is characterized by complete development
of the Principal Chorus, the sound most associated with the organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the lower manual on a 2-manual organ
and the middle manual on a 3-manual organ.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Harmonic</b> &ndash; Any one if the
many partials that give a musical tone its primary quality is called a
harmonic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relative intensity of
these harmonics determines the tonal quality of a given sound.</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Hertz (Hz)</b> &ndash; Frequency of
a wave-form (sound wave) in cycles per second.<span style="">&nbsp;
            </span>Organ tone ranges from 16Hz up to 22,000Hz (22kHz).</small><br>



            <small>

            </small><br>



            <small>&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></small><small><b>Hybrid</b> &ndash; Tapered flue
