A little; a small quantity; a measured supply.<br>

      <p align="left"><font face="Footlight MT Light">The Modicum is
the beginning of a long-anticipated journey.&nbsp; The final
destination will be a boat large enough to enjoy a week-end on with
family and friends, and safe enough to return home safely even with a
bit of fowl weather.&nbsp;<br>

I have lived my entire life on the Gulf Coast of Alabama (yes, we have a coast!) and have<br>
been fascinated with boats from an early age. All types of boats, from
the flat punt-like boats used by old-time oystermen, to sleek,
sophisticated sailing yachts.<br>

I've been around water and boats but have never owned one of my own.<br>

Now I do.<br>

It is called "Modicum".</font></p>

      <p align="left"><font face="Footlight MT Light">Modicum is my own
design based on the well-know "internet plans".&nbsp; I didn't order
any plans, nor&nbsp; did I draw any plans... I built a boat.&nbsp; I
didn't re-invent the wheel here, but just put some of "me" into a
simple boat design. I'm not a boat designer, but I have
building and designing experience spanning over 35 years.&nbsp; I have
been a contractor designing houses, an artist/sculptor, a
screen-printer, a house painter, a carpenter, a furniture
designer/builder, antique refinisher/restorer, a Church Organ Dealer, a
web-designer, and even a cook... so why not design and build a boat?<br>

      <br>
She started as a Cajun Pirogue-type canoe, but since I have always
liked the graceful sweeping lines of Dories, some of that was in the
mix, accounting for the slight lift in the chine.&nbsp; This probably
reduced the over-all load capacity of the little craft, but, as an
artist, I see it as an equal trade. So what have we now? A "P-dory" or
a "Do-Rougue". Your choice...It's up to you.<br>
